							<h3 class="sub-heading-txt">Cats are low-maintenance and independent</h3>
							<p class="subtxt">If you think you do not have the time or energy to own a pet, then a cat could be perfect for you. Taking care of a cat requires less responsibility than some other animals. Those who have full-time jobs can rest easy, knowing that their kitty can take care of itself for the most part. And when you do have extra time, cuddling up with your cat will feel better than ever.</p>

							<h3 class="sub-heading-txt">Cats can help reduce stress</h3>
							<p class="subtxt">We all get stressed out, and people have many different ways of relieving their stress. Cat owners can reduce tensions by just stroking their furry friend’s head. Petting a cat releases endorphins into the brain, which makes you happier. Also, cats have the softest fur!</p>
